                  This is a logo we developed for a company that does
                  medical-legal consultation and research.

                <h1 className="text-minimum font-sf-regular text-dark-green pb-16">
                  The client ordered our Silver Package, challenging us to come
                  up with a new logo that somehow shows both the medical and the
                  legal sides of the business.

            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              Going on the client's instructions and example images we tried to
              create a blend of the primary medical symbol, the caduceus
              (snake(s) around a pole) and a symbol common in the legal sector,
              the scales of justice. We created several custom logos around that
              idea.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              The preview shown to the right is about 50% of the size of the
              actual one shown to the client.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              The client liked designs C, D and E, but felt that design E had
              too much of a moustache feel. In hindsight, we have to agree!
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              The client asked for more designs along these lines, but not
              necessarily with the caduceus/scales combination.

            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              We normally send the logos in sets of between 3 and 7 designs,
              allowing the client to post feedback in-between design sessions
              and steer the general logo design direction.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              Ok, to the right is the second batch, trying various medical/legal
              symbols and ways of combining them.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              The client showed these logos around and the consensus was that C
              and E were the stronger candidates. Design E was most liked, but
              not the colors. In design C, everyone liked the colors of the
              serpent.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              With design E the client was concerned that the lack of any
              medical reference would be a problem.

            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              Working with design E from the previous set, we created variations
              of the design, incorporating the snake to link the logo to the
              medical profession.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              At this point in the process we suggested to the client that a
              logo does not necessarily have to illustrate the nature of the
              business. We suggested using the company initial "M" to create
              some options for the next set.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              The client gave us the thumbs-up to try with the company initials
              "MLCG".

            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              As discussed with the client, we changed direction here to create
              letter logos. We love letter logos. We love them so much that we
              created a second web site called letterlogos.com.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              But back to this logo project: In most cases, fewer letters make
              better logos (because simpler logos are more memorable).
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              We tried two logos with all four company initials, then tried
              three using only the "M" initial.
            </h1>
            <h1 className="text-dark-green font-minimum font-sf-regular pb-4">
              The client specifically asked to see designs with all four
              letters, so the three "M" logos shown here would not count towards
              the maximum of 15 designs available to the client with the Silver
              Package.
